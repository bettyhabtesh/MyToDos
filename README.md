A ToDo List App+
To-Do List React App
This is a fully functional to-do list React app that I developed by following a YouTube tutorial posted by Ope Afolabi. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, and helps them stay organized by providing a simple and intuitive user interface.

Features
Create a new task by entering a description and pressing Enter or clicking the "Add Task" button.
Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task.
Edit task descriptions by clicking on the task and modifying the text.
Delete tasks by clicking on the trash can icon next to each task.
Filter tasks based on their completion status using the filter buttons ("All", "Active", and "Completed").
Clear all completed tasks with a single click using the "Clear Completed" button.
Installation
To run the to-do list app locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-react-app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
